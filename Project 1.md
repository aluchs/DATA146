# Project 1.5

This project involves 3 simple questions on manipulating pandas dataframes. Below I have added each question and my solutions to each of them. First, we must import pandas and create a path to our dataset so that it can be imported. 

`import pandas as pd
path_to_data = 'C:/Users/Andrew/Desktop/COLLEGE STUFF/Spring 2021/Intro Data Science/Week 2/gapminder.tsv'
data = pd.read_csv(path_to_data, sep = '\t') 
data.head()` 

## Exercise 1
### Get a list of all the years in this data, without any duplicates. How many unique values are there, and what are they?

First, we need to get a list of all of the unique instances in the 'years' column of our dataset. This can be done simply with the .unique() function. We then print the function to make sure that there are no duplicates in our new list, and to show what the unique values are.

`uniqueyears = data.year.unique()
print(uniqueyears)`

The unique values are [1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 2002 2007]. To answer the next part of the question, we should find out how long our list is. We can do this by using len().

`print(len(uniqueyears))`

## Exercise 2
### What is the largest value for population (pop) in this data? When and where did this occur?

maxpop = data['pop'].max() #Finds the highest value in the 'pop' column and assigns it to an object
print(maxpop) #Prints our new object to make sure the output looks correct

maxpopcontext = data.loc[data['pop'] == maxpop] #Use .loc to find rows where maxpop was their population value
print(maxpopcontext) #Prints out the results of our last function. Based on the row, we can see that the maxpop occured in China in 2007.

#Exercise 3
#Extract all the records for Europe. In 1952, which country had the smallest population, and what was the population in 2007?

europeonly = data.loc[data['continent'] == 'Europe'] #Subset the data to only find rows with 'Europe' in the 'continent' column
print(europeonly) #Check our output to make sure everything looks correct
europeonly1952 = europeonly.loc[europeonly['year'] == 1952] #subsets our dataset with Europe only to get only rows that have a 'year' value of 1952
print(europeonly1952) #Print our output to make sure our past work looks correct

minpop = europeonly1952['pop'].min() #Finds the minimum population within our subsetted data of rows including Europe and the year 1952
print(minpop)
minpopcontext = europeonly1952.loc[europeonly1952['pop'] == minpop] #Pulls the row that has our minimum population value out
minpopcontext #Prints our work to see the minimum population value. Iceland had the smallest population in 1952 at 147,962 people.

Icelandonly = data.loc[data['country'] == 'Iceland']
Iceland2007 = Icelandonly.loc[Icelandonly['year'] ==  2007]
Iceland2007 #We can see through the above work that the population of Iceland in 2007 had grown to 301,931 people.
