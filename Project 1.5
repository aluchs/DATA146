import pandas as pd
path_to_data = 'C:/Users/Andrew/Desktop/COLLEGE STUFF/Spring 2021/Intro Data Science/Week 2/gapminder.tsv' #Setting the path to my dataset
data = pd.read_csv(path_to_data, sep = '\t') #Import the dataset and assign it to an object
data.head() #Check if the data imported correctly

#Exercise 1
#Get a list of all the years in this data, without any duplicates. How many unique values are there, and what are they?

uniqueyears = data.year.unique() #This will find all of the unique instances in the 'years' column of our dataset
print(uniqueyears) #Check the output to make sure it looks correct, as well as shows the unique year values that there are

print(len(uniqueyears)) #Finds out the length of the list made by our previous work, which will show how many unique years are in the dataset

#Exercise 2
#What is the largest value for population (pop) in this data? When and where did this occur?

maxpop = data['pop'].max() #Finds the highest value in the 'pop' column and assigns it to an object
print(maxpop) #Prints our new object to make sure the output looks correct

maxpopcontext = data.loc[data['pop'] == maxpop] #Use .loc to find rows where maxpop was their population value
print(maxpopcontext) #Prints out the results of our last function. Based on the row, we can see that the maxpop occured in China in 2007.

#Exercise 3
#Extract all the records for Europe. In 1952, which country had the smallest population, and what was the population in 2007?

europeonly = data.loc[data['continent'] == 'Europe'] #Subset the data to only find rows with 'Europe' in the 'continent' column
print(europeonly) #Check our output to make sure everything looks correct
europeonly1952 = europeonly.loc[europeonly['year'] == 1952] #subsets our dataset with Europe only to get only rows that have a 'year' value of 1952
print(europeonly1952) #Print our output to make sure our past work looks correct

minpop = europeonly1952['pop'].min() #Finds the minimum population within our subsetted data of rows including Europe and the year 1952
print(minpop)
minpopcontext = europeonly1952.loc[europeonly1952['pop'] == minpop] #Pulls the row that has our minimum population value out
minpopcontext #Prints our work to see the minimum population value. Iceland had the smallest population in 1952 at 147,962 people.

Icelandonly = data.loc[data['country'] == 'Iceland']
Iceland2007 = Icelandonly.loc[Icelandonly['year'] ==  2007]
Iceland2007 #We can see through the above work that the population of Iceland in 2007 had grown to 301,931 people.
