# Project 5 Part 1

## In this episode of DATA146, we take on linear, ridge, and lasso regression, all with minimal assistance. Truly a challenge for the ages, so lets get right into it!

## Question 1
##### Download the anonymized dataset describing persons.csv from a West African county and import it into your PyCharm project workspace (right click and download from the above link or you can also find the data pinned to the slack channel). First set the variable wealthC as your target. It is not necessary to set a seed.

Simple! We can use panda's read_csv to import our .csv file. In looking at the data, there needs to be some cleaning performed as several NaN entries exist in the dataset, which won't work well with our models. We can use dropna to remove these variables. By using .shape, we know that dropping the NaN values brought our dataset from 47,974 entries to 47,891 entries. That means we only lost about 80 rows, which in a dataset of over 47,000 is a minimal loss. Next, we must remove our target variables from the dataset so they do not influence our projections of the model's fit on the data. Specifically, we can use .drop to remove both the wealthC and wealthI variables. 


## Question 2
##### Perform a linear regression and compute the MSE. Standardize the features and again compute the MSE. Compare the coefficients from each of the two models and describe how they have changed.

For this problem we will use LinearRegression from the sklearn library. Now that our dataset is properly cleaned, we can use LinearRegression to calculate the MSE for both WealthI and WealthC as they are and after being standardized. MSE can be calculated with the below line of code once you have your actual y and predicted y from the linear regression.

```
mse = np.mean((y-y_pred)**2)
```

Below is a table showing the MSEs for WealthC and WealthI, both as-is and after being standardized. I used StandardScaler from the sklearn library in order to standardize the variables. 

| MSEs  | Un-Standardized | Standardized  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| WealthC | 8308093399.704249  | 0.44285065024071685 |
| WealthI  | 1750276834.930475  | 10058370204.424  |

Because MSE is relative, we are not looking to find the objectively best fitting model, but can use our results to compare betweent the models. The standardized WealthC model seemed to do the best by far, to the point where I am wondering if there is an error but could not find any. Regardless, the next best performing model was the WealthI standardized, so across the board standardization seemed to help with our performance. Not too far behind that was the WealthI un-standardized model, and way behind that was the WealthC un-standardized model. 


## Question 3
##### Run a ridge regression and report your best results.

First, we'll run a ridge regression with WealthC as our target variable. The first step in running a ridge regression is to find our alpha parameter. Similar to the midterm, this can be done by using our DoKFold function in a loop for all alpha values in a range. To save time, we will start with a wide range of alpha values but only test ~20 points within that wide range. By doing that, we can quickly scope in to where we believe the best alpha value is located. We'll start by running our ridge regression for 20 values between 50 and 200. The output gives us the below plot.

We can see here that the highest peak for the R^2 values is between 70 and 80. Upon running the regression for points between 70 and 80, I determined that the strongest alpha value could be found between 74 and 76. Below is the plot for that final iteration of the ridge regression.

Now we can see that the strongest alpha value for this regression is about 75.5. By finding the maximum R^2 value found in our loop, the best alpha value is found to more specifically be 75.5689. By using that alpha value, we get an R^2 of 0.7354, meaning that the model actually does a relatively good job in predicting values for this dataset. 


We can go through a similar process for the variable WealthI. We will start our search for the strongest alpha parameter between 50 and 150, using 20 different points. After running that code we get this plot, indicating that the best alpha parameter will be around 80.

We will center our search more around that point, using values between 80 and 90. This outputs the below plot, indicating that the strongest alpha parameter is around 93. By finding the maximum value of R^2 in our loop, we can see more specifically that the best alpha parameter in the range is 93.42, which gives us a R^2 value of 0.8249. That R^2 value means that the ridge regression predicts our target variable of WealthI very well, and shows that the regression was stronger for WealthI than it was for WealthC.

## Question 4
##### Run a lasso regression and report your best results.

The process of running a lasso regression is very similar to that of a ridge regression. The major difference is that alpha values tend to be much lower, so in making a model for WealthC, I started my search with 20 values between .000000001 and 2. I used a very low decimal because using 0 returned errors for me, but I found that low decimals had relatively minimal differences in the R^2 values they were returning. The first plot I returned is below. It indicates that for this model, the closer to 0 the better for our R^2 value.

The results from that plot helped me to refine my search with values close to 0, so I then tested 20 values between .000000001 and .01. The plot below shows that an alpha value of  0.008947 returns the highest R^2 value, which is 0.7561. This means that the model does a relatively good job of predicting its target (a discussion we will go a bit more in to later).

Now on to lasso regression for WealthI. We will use the same process for this target and start by running 20 values in between .000000001 and 2. Our initial plot indicates that the best alpha value to use is around 0.5, so we will tighten our search down to values between .45 and .55. The plot below shows the results for this more limited search.
