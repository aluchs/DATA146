# DATA 146 - Introduction to Data Science
## Andrew Luchs

### Project 0.5
In this project, we manipulated a simple dataset on population data to get a refresher on subsetting in python.

### Project 2
Completed 3/2/21
Plots! Logarithms! Packages! All of the above are included in this 4 question project on how to communicate trends in data as best as possible.

### Project 3
Completed 3/16/21 
This project involves 4 questions on linear regression and ridge regression combined with more basic python techniques of slicing, loops, and creating functions.

### Midterm Corrections
A tricky midterm, and a chance at redemption - this project has my midterm corrections, including why I got wrong what I got wrong.

### Project 5, Part 1
In this project we were set out into the wild to create models on our own with linear, ridge, and lasso regression.
